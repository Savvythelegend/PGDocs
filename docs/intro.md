### Welcome to the CloudNativePG Documentation
This site contains the official documentation for **CloudNativePG**, the open-source operator designed to manage PostgreSQL workloads on any Kubernetes cluster.

Our goal is to provide clear, comprehensive, and accurate information to help you deploy, manage, and operate PostgreSQL in a truly cloud-native way.

These documentation pages are built directly from the [operator's source code](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg) and will be versioned alongside the operator's releases.

### Getting Started

Whether you are new to CloudNativePG or an experienced user, here are some helpful sections to get you started quickly:

- **Quickstart:** The fastest way to get a PostgreSQL cluster up and running.
- **Architecture:** Understand the components of CloudNativePG and how they work together.
- **Installation & Upgrade:** Detailed instructions for installing or upgrading the operator.
